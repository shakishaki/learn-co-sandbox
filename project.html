    <p class="w3-justify">Our mission is to fuel the movement of kindness in modern society for youth. The youth today is our future generation, our future world, and through empowerment, education, and positivity we believe that we can help the world become a better place. We would like to provide resources for young teens to get involved whether it be through movements, school activities, programs, or through your community. No matter what we do, our goal remains the same--being compassionate and uplifting those around us in various ways.  We believe that small things here can contribute to a movement of great good.  It’s time to stop waiting for the next person to make a change and bring about change yourself. Put the ‘I’ in kind.

    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>One kind action can start a ripple effect.</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Our world is far from perfect.  However, with small acts of kindness, we can change the world for the better.  One good deed can create a domino effect that enhances and improves the lives of many.  Kindness is proven to produce endorphins, which are your body’s natural painkillers! In addition, acts of kindness can reduce stress, pain, anxiety, and depression. Start by clicking the dropdown menu that states “GET INVOLVED” to begin spreading positivity through your school or community today!</p>
